# MATLAB-Code-for-Frequency-Modulation
This repository contains the MATLAB code for frequency modulation. 
I have done frequency modulation simulation using MATLAB. Note: I have done this using matlab code and not simulink. If you find any difficulty you can change the time parameter. I have taken fm =10 and fc = 100 and the output is shown in the image. For bigger values the code needs to be modified.
